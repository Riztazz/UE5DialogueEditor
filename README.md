# UE5DialogueEditor
UE4/5 Dialogue Editor like Bioware's Dragon Age Origins. 

Slate & C++. Open source.  
Current license requires you to correctly answer: "Is it possible you are a human being?". Do not use this unless you provide the correct answer, to yourself.

**Not production ready.**

For new or existing complex multi-branching dialogues. But I guess it's better for new dialogues, the existing ones I used as a test are from Bioware. It also requires you to create your own plots data tables, some examples included, also from Bioware
